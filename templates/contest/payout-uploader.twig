Dear {{ username }},

{% if nr_entries == 0 %}
During {{ name }} that ran from {{ date.begin }} to {{ date.end }}, you uploaded {{ nr_entries }} {{ entries }}. Each upload turned out to be worth {{ per_entry_bonus|number_format(2) }} bonus points, so your uploading activity earnt you a total of {{ user_bonus|number_format(2) }} points!

On top of that, just because you participated, you have been awarded a further {{ contest_bonus|number_format(2) }} points. And since you are awesome and are on Orpheus anyway, the cherry on top is an additional {{ enabled_bonus|number_format(2) }} points.

All in all, you have been granted {{ (enabled_bonus + contest_bonus + user_bonus)|number_format(2) }} bonus points. Enjoy!
{% else %}
During {{ name }} that ran from {{ date.begin }} to {{ date.end }}, you didn't upload anything. So sad, because you missed out on {{ contest_bonus|number_format(2) }} bonus pointsjust for participating even once, and an additional {{ per_entry_bonus|number_format(2) }} points for each successful upload.

All is not lost, because thanks to the love and generosity of the Orpheus community, you have been granted {{ enabled_bonus|number_format(2) }} bonus points for having being here during the contest!
