Dear {{ user.username }},

The following {% if many %}uploads were{% else %}upload was{% endif %} removed {#
-#} because nobody was seeding {% if many %}them{% else %}it{% endif %}. If you still {#
-#} have the files (and assuming it didn't break any rules), please feel free to {#
-#} re-upload it. Keep in mind, though, if you had reseeded it, you would have {#
-#} earned more bonus points than if you upload a fresh version.

The following upload{{ total|plural }} {% if many %}were{% else %}was{% endif %} removed:
{% for tgroup in list %}
[*] [url=torrents.php?id={{ tgroup.id }}]{{ tgroup.name }}[/url]
{% endfor %}

Remember, seeding uploads earns bonus points on {{ constant('SITE_NAME') }}.
