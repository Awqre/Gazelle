    endif %} didn't break any rules (we hope), please feel free to re-upload {% if many %}them{% else %}it{% endif %}.

The following upload{{ total|plural }} {% if many %}were{% else %}was{% endif %} removed:
{% for n in notes %}
[*] [url=torrents.php?id={{ n.tgroup.id }}]{{ n.name }}[/url]
{% endfor %}
