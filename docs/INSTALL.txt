INSTALLATION NOTES
1. Set up MySQL and memcached. memcached can be started with the command:
    memcached -d -m 5120 -s /var/run/memcached.sock -a 0777 -t4 -C -u nobody
    This starts 4 threads and gives it 5 gigs of RAM
2. Run gazelle.sql (preferably as root) to create the database, the table, and the default data.
3. Install Sphinx - we recommend you use the included sphinx.conf. You can copy this to
    /etc/sphinx/sphinx.conf. You need to fill in the details of the SQL server though!

    You might also need to create the /var/lib/sphinx folder.

    For documentation, read http://www.sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html

    After you've installed sphinx, create the indices:
    /usr/bin/indexer -c /etc/sphinx/sphinx.conf --all

4. Move classes/config.template to classes/config.php. Edit the config.php as needed.
    We use http://grc.com/passwords.html for our passwords - you'll be generating a lot of these.
5. Sign up. The first user is made a SysOp!
6. Set up cron jobs. You need a cron job for the schedule, a cron job for
the peerupdate (all groups are cached, but the peer counts change often,
so peerupdate is a script to update them), and the two Sphinx indices.
These are our cron jobs. SCHEDULE_KEY is the same as in classes/config.php:

0,15,30,45 *    *       *       *       /usr/bin/php /var/www/vhosts/what/schedule.php SCHEDULE_KEY >> /root/schedule.log
10,25,40,55 *  *        *       *       /usr/bin/php /var/www/vhosts/what/peerupdate.php SCHEDULE_KEY >> /root/peerupdate.log
*       *       *       *       *       /usr/bin/indexer -c /etc/sphinx/sphinx.conf --rotate delta requests_delta log_delta >/dev/null
5       0,12    *       *       *       /usr/bin/indexer -c /etc/sphinx/sphinx.conf --rotate --all >>/root/sphinx-indexer.log

6. Start modifying stuff. Hopefully, everything will have gone smoothly so far and nothing will have exploded (ha ha ha)
